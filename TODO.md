# TODOs

## UI

### Beginning of round screen
* Choices to be made relating to end of the round events (eg death)
* Do you want to go into power down?

### Cards can be dragged to phase slot

### Clickable bots and fields
These to provide extra information when clicked (accordeon?)

### Animation in history view
Provide animation in the history view

### Option cards UI
Probably a set of option cards that can be turned on or off for the round
And other option cards can be used to modify movements - then it needs to be possible to put two movement cards in one phase


## Engine

### Full support for option cards

### Support for a few general rule changes:
* Flags can be moved by the board (or not)
* Lasers can be moved and turned by the board (or not)
