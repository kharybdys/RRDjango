# Roborally

This is version two of my attempt to write a Roborally player.
When I switched companies from Java-based to Python-based (and with a Django application), I used this project to familiarize myself with both Python and Django.

In the meantime I've come to the conclusion that I hate Django as a framework because it forces its structure on everything, and I can't separate the data models from the database connection.

So I'm restarting this attempt again, see [https://github.com/kharybdys/roborally]
